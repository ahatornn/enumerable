enumerable is a Go library for functional-style data processing using **generics** and **lazy iterators**.

It lets you filter, transform, and aggregate data in a clean, readable way ‚Äî without for loops or intermediate slices. Operations are evaluated lazily, meaning no unnecessary allocations or eager processing, making it efficient even for large or streaming datasets.

> Composable. Lazy. Generic. Type-safe.

## ‚ú® Features

- ‚úÖ **Functional pipeline operators**: Chainable methods like Where, Select, Take, Skip, First, Any, All, Count, and more - all evaluated lazily and fully type-safe.
- ‚úÖ **Lazy iterators** ‚Äî data is processed on-demand.
- ‚úÖ **Generics (Go 1.18+)** ‚Äî type safety without type casting.
- ‚úÖ **Method chaining** ‚Äî fluent, readable APIs.
- ‚úÖ **Efficiency** ‚Äî minimal allocations, suitable for large datasets.
- ‚úÖ **Nil-safe operations** ‚Äî methods safely handle nil sequences without panics.
- ‚úÖ **Two enumerator types** ‚Äî EnumeratorAny[T any] for any type and Enumerator[T comparable] for comparable types with enhanced functionality.
- ‚úÖ **Set operations for comparable types** ‚Äî additional methods like Distinct, Except, Intersect, and Union available when working with comparable data.

## üì¶ Installation

Use go get to add the enumerable to your project:

```bash
go get github.com/ahatornn/enumerable@latest
```

## ‚öñÔ∏è Comparison: Enumerable vs Vanilla Go

Let‚Äôs say you want to: Merge two slices, keep numbers greater than 50, skip the first 3, and take the next 2.

### ‚úÖ Using enumerable

```go
nums1 := []int{19, 63, 25, 19, 47, 91, 58}
nums2 := []int{80, 25, 91, 36, 19, 52, 74, 36}

result := enumerable.FromSlice(nums1).
	Union(enumerable.FromSlice(nums2)).
	Where(func(x int) bool { return x > 50 }).
	Skip(3).
	Take(2).
	ToSlice()

fmt.Println(result) // Result: [80 52]
```

### üõ† Manual

```go
seen := make(map[int]bool)
var filtered []int
for _, x := range a {
	if x > 50 && !seen[x] {
		seen[x] = true
		filtered = append(filtered, x)
	}
}
for _, x := range b {
	if x > 50 && !seen[x] {
		seen[x] = true
		filtered = append(filtered, x)
	}
}
skip := 3
if skip >= len(filtered) {
	return nil
}
afterSkip := filtered[skip:]
take := 2
if take > len(afterSkip) {
	take = len(afterSkip)
}
return afterSkip[:take]
```

### üöÄ Performance Benchmarks

Comparison between the enumerable and manual implementation across different dataset sizes (go 1.24.1, cpu: 12th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-12700F, goos: windows, goarch: amd64):
| Records | enumerable (ns/op) | Manual (ns/op) | Speed Ratio | Memory (enumerable ‚Üí Manual) | Allocs (enumerable ‚Üí Manual) |
|-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|
| 10 | 809 | 382 | 0.47x | 1.2KB ‚Üí 0.6KB | 12 ‚Üí 8 |
| 50 | 2,104 | 1,893 | 0.9x  | 2.4KB ‚Üí 3.1KB | 14 ‚Üí 14 |
| 100 | 2,945 | 6,611 | 2.24x | 4.7KB ‚Üí 13.4KB | 16 ‚Üí 20 |
| 1,000 | 3,023 | 93,675 | 31x | 4.7KB ‚Üí 208KB | 16 ‚Üí 43 |
| 5,000 | 3,092 | 389,795 | 126x | 4.7KB ‚Üí 817KB | 16 ‚Üí 93 |
#### Key Insights
1. **Small datasets (‚â§50 records)**:
   - Minimal difference (manual 0.9-2x faster)
   - enumerable uses less memory (-23% at 50 records)

2. **Medium/large datasets (‚â•100 records)**:
   - enumerable is **2-126x faster**
   - Saves **up to 99% memory** (at 5,000 records)
   - Consistent execution time (~3 ns) regardless of size

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methods
### üå± Creation Methods
Initialize new sequences from scratch.
- Often act as entry points to the API.
- May accept minimal input (or none) to generate data.
- For each method that works with comparable types, there is a corresponding [name]Any variant that works with any types.

| Method | Description |
|--|--|
| [Empty](./empty.go) | Returns an empty [Enumerator[T]](./enumerator.go) of type T that yields no values with comparable types only. |
| [EmptyAny](./empty.go) | Returns an empty [EnumeratorAny[T]](./enumerator.go) of type T that yields no values with any types. |
| [FromChannel](./from_channel.go) | Creates an [Enumerator[T]](./enumerator.go) that yields values received from a channel.<br>The enumeration continues until the channel is closed or the consumer stops iteration with comparable types only. |
| [FromChannelAny](./from_channel.go) | Creates an [EnumeratorAny[T]](./enumerator.go) that yields values received from a channel.<br>The enumeration continues until the channel is closed or the consumer stops iteration with any types. |
| [FromSlice](./from_slice.go) | Creates an [Enumerator[T]](./enumerator.go) that yields all elements from the input slice in order with comparable types only. |
| [FromSliceAny](./from_slice.go) | Creates an [EnumeratorAny[T]](./enumerator.go) that yields all elements from the input slice in order with any types. |
| [Range](./range.go) | Generates a sequence of consecutive integers starting at 'start', producing exactly 'count' values in ascending order (with step +1) with comparable types only. |

| [RepeatAny](./repeat.go) | Generates an [EnumeratorAny[T]](./enumerator.go) containing the same item repeated 'count' times with any types. |

## ‚è≥ Lazy Methods
Perform deferred computations, evaluating only when needed
- Chainable without intermediate allocations.
- Save memory/CPU until iteration.

| Method | Description |
|--|--|
| [Concat](./concat.go) | Combines two enumerations into a single enumeration. The resulting enumeration yields all elements from the first enumeration, followed by all elements from the second enumeration. |
| [DefaultIfEmpty](./default_if_empty.go) | Returns an enumeration that contains the elements of the current enumeration, or a single default value if the current enumeration is empty. |
| [Distinct](./distinct.go) | Returns an enumerator that yields only unique elements from the original enumeration. Each element appears only once in the result, regardless of how many times it appears in the source.<br/><br/>‚ö†Ô∏è Performance note: This operation buffers all unique elements encountered so far in memory. For enumerations with many unique elements, memory usage can become significant. The operation is not memory-bounded<br/>‚ÑπÔ∏è Available only for comparable types. |
| [Distinct](./distinct.go) | Returnsan enumerator that yields only unique elements from the original enumeration using a custom  [equality comparer](comparer/equality_comparer.go) to determine uniqueness. Each element appears only once in the result, regardless of how many times it appears in the source.<br/><br/>‚ö†Ô∏è Performance note: This operation buffers all unique elements encountered so far in memory. For enumerations with many unique elements, memory usage can become significant. The operation is not memory-bounded.<br/>‚ö†Ô∏è Performance warning: This operation can be significantly slower than Distinct() for comparable types due to the overhead of EqualityComparer interface calls and hash-based collision resolution. Consider using Distinct() with comparable types when possible for better performance.<br/>‚ö†Ô∏è Allocation warning: This operation performs multiple memory allocations during execution, especially for enumerations with many unique elements. Each unique element requires storage in internal hash buckets, leading to increased GC pressure. |
| [Except](./except.go) | Returns an enumerator that yields elements from the first enumeration that are not present in the second enumeration. This is equivalent to set difference operation (first - second).<br/><br/>‚ö†Ô∏è Performance note: This operation completely buffers the second enumerator into memory (creates a map for fast lookup). For large second enumerations, this may consume significant memory. The memory usage is proportional to the number of unique elements in the second enumerator.<br/>‚ÑπÔ∏è Available only for comparable types. |
| [Except](./except.go) | Returns an [EnumeratorAny[T]](./enumerator.go) that yields elements from the first enumeration that are not present in the second enumeration using the provided [equality comparer](comparer/equality_comparer.go). This is equivalent to set difference operation (first - second).<br/><br/>‚ö†Ô∏è Performance note: This operation completely buffers the `second` enumerator into memory (creates a hash set for fast lookup). For large second enumerations, this may consume significant memory. The memory usage is proportional to the number of unique elements in the second enumerator.<br/>‚ö†Ô∏è Memory note: This operation buffers elements from both enumerations for duplicate detection and exclusion checking. Memory usage scales with the number of unique elements in both enumerations. |
| [Intersect](./intersect.go) | Returns an enumerator that yields elements present in both enumerations. This is equivalent to set intersection operation (first ‚à© second).<br/><br/>‚ö†Ô∏è Performance note: The second enumeration is completely loaded into memory to enable fast lookups. Be cautious when using this with very large second enumerations as it may cause high memory usage.<br/>‚ÑπÔ∏è Available only for comparable types. |
| [OrderBy](./order_by.go) | Sorts the elements of a sequence in ascending order according to a comparer function and return [OrderEnumerator[T]](./order_enumerator.go). This method is the primary sorting operation that establishes the first sorting level.<br/><br/>‚ö†Ô∏è Performance note: This is a deferred execution operation that accumulates sorting rules. Actual sorting computation occurs during first enumeration. Time complexity: O(1) for rule accumulation, O(n log n) for actual sorting during enumeration. |
| [OrderByDescending](./order_by.go) | Sorts the elements of a sequence in descending order according to a comparer function and return [OrderEnumerator[T]](./order_enumerator.go). This method is the primary sorting operation that establishes the first sorting level.<br/><br/>‚ö†Ô∏è Performance note: This is a deferred execution operation that accumulates sorting rules. Actual sorting computation occurs during first enumeration. Time complexity: O(1) for rule accumulation, O(n log n) for actual sorting during enumeration. |
| [Skip](./skip.go) | Bypasses a specified number of elements in an enumeration and then yields the remaining elements. This operation is useful for pagination, skipping headers, or bypassing initial elements. |
| [SkipLast](./skip_last.go) | Bypasses a specified number of elements at the end of an enumeration and yields the remaining elements. This operation is useful for removing trailing elements like footers, summaries, or fixed-size endings from sequences.<br/><br/>‚ö†Ô∏è Performance note: This operation buffers up to n elements in memory using a circular buffer for efficient memory usage. For large values of n, this may consume significant memory.<br/>‚ö†Ô∏è Evaluation note: This operation is partially lazy - elements are processed as the enumeration proceeds, but the last n elements are buffered and never yielded. The enumeration must progress beyond n elements to yield earlier ones. |
| [SkipWhile](./skip_while.go) | Bypasses elements in an enumeration as long as a specified condition is true and then yields the remaining elements. This operation is useful for skipping elements until a certain condition is met. |
| [Take](./take.go) | Returns a specified number of contiguous elements from the start of an enumeration. This operation is useful for pagination, limiting results, or taking samples from sequences. |
| [TakeLast](./take_last.go) | Returns a specified number of contiguous elements from the end of an enumeration. This operation is useful for getting the final elements, such as last N records, trailing averages, or end-of-sequence markers.<br/><br/>‚ö†Ô∏è Performance note: This operation buffers up to n elements in memory to track which elements should be yielded. For large values of n, this may consume significant memory. All elements must be processed before any are yielded.<br/>‚ö†Ô∏è Evaluation note: This operation is not lazy in the traditional sense - the entire source enumeration must be consumed before yielding begins. Elements are yielded in order of their appearance in the original enumeration. |
| [TakeWhile](./take_while.go) | Returns elements from an enumeration as long as a specified condition is true. This operation is useful for taking elements until a certain condition is met, such as taking elements while they are valid or within a range. |
| [ThenBy](./then_by.go) | Performs a subsequent ordering of the elements in ascending order according to a comparer function and return [OrderEnumerator[T]](./order_enumerator.go). This method adds a secondary (or further) sorting level to an existing ordered sequence.<br/><br/>‚ö†Ô∏è Performance note: This is a deferred execution operation that accumulates sorting rules. Actual sorting computation occurs during first enumeration. Time complexity: O(1) for rule accumulation, O(n log n) for actual sorting during enumeration with all accumulated rules. |
| [ThenByDescending](./then_by.go) | Performs a subsequent ordering of the elements in descending order according to a comparer function and return [OrderEnumerator[T]](./order_enumerator.go). This method adds a secondary (or further) sorting level to an existing ordered sequence.<br/><br/>‚ö†Ô∏è Performance note: This is a deferred execution operation that accumulates sorting rules. Actual sorting computation occurs during first enumeration. Time complexity: O(1) for rule accumulation, O(n log n) for actual sorting during enumeration with all accumulated rules. |
| [Union](./union.go) | Produces the set union of two enumerations by using the default equality comparer. This operation returns unique elements that appear in either enumeration.<br/><br/>‚ö†Ô∏è Performance note: This operation buffers all unique elements encountered so far in memory. For enumerations with many unique elements, memory usage can become significant. The operation is not memory-bounded.<br/>‚ÑπÔ∏è Available only for comparable types. |
| [Where](./where.go) | Filters an enumeration based on a predicate function. This operation returns elements that satisfy the specified condition. |

For large enumerations, this may be expensive.<br/>‚ö†Ô∏è Memory note: This operation does not buffer elements, but it must process the entire enumeration, which may trigger upstream operations. |
| [ElementAt](./element_at.go) | Returns the element at the specified index in the sequence. This operation is useful when you need to access an element at a specific position without iterating through the entire sequence.<br/><br/>‚ö†Ô∏è Performance note: This is a terminal operation that must iterate through the sequence until the specified index is reached.<br/>‚ö†Ô∏è Memory note: This operation does not buffer elements, only tracks current position. |

This operation is useful for performing side effects like printing, logging, or modifying external state for each element.<br/><br/>‚ö†Ô∏è Performance note: This operation must iterate through the entire enumeration, which may be expensive for large enumerations.<br/>‚ö†Ô∏è Side effects warning: The action function may have side effects. Use with caution in functional programming contexts. |
| [LastOrDefault](./last_or_default.go) | Returns the last element of an enumeration, or a default value if the enumeration is empty or nil.<br/><br/>‚ö†Ô∏è Performance note: This is a terminal operation that must iterate through the entire enumeration to find the last element.

For large sequences with multiple elements, this may process more elements than necessary.<br/>‚ö†Ô∏è Memory note: This operation does not buffer elements, but it must process the entire enumeration, which may trigger upstream operations.<br/>‚ÑπÔ∏è Available only for comparable types. |
| [SingleBy](./single_by.go) | Returns the single element of a sequence that satisfies the provided [equality comparer](comparer/equality_comparer.go).<br/><br/>‚ö†Ô∏è Performance note: This is a terminal operation that must iterate through the sequence until completion or second distinct element found. For large sequences with multiple distinct elements, this may process more elements than necessary.<br/>‚ö†Ô∏è Memory note: This operation buffers elements to perform equality comparison using hash-based lookup. Memory usage depends on the number of distinct elements encountered during processing. |
| [SingleOrDefault](./single.go) | Returns the single element of a sequence using default equality comparison, or a specified default value if the sequence is empty.<br/><br/>‚ö†Ô∏è Performance note: This is a terminal operation that must iterate through the sequence until completion or second element found. For large sequences with multiple elements, this may process more elements than necessary.<br/>‚ö†Ô∏è Memory note: This operation does not buffer elements, but it must process the entire enumeration, which may trigger upstream operations.<br/>‚ÑπÔ∏è Available only for comparable types. |
| [SumFloat](./sum_float.go) | Computes the sum of float32 values obtained by applying a selector function to each element in the enumeration. This operation is useful for calculating totals, aggregates, or numeric summaries with floating-point precision.<br/><br/>‚ö†Ô∏è Performance note: This is a terminal operation that must iterate through the entire enumeration to sum all values. For large enumerations, this may be expensive.<br/>‚ö†Ô∏è Precision warning: Floating-point arithmetic may introduce small rounding errors. Consider using appropriate rounding for display. |
| [SumInt](./sum_int.go) | Computes the sum of integers obtained by applying a selector function to each element in the enumeration. This operation is useful for calculating totals, aggregates, or numeric summaries.<br/><br/>‚ö†Ô∏è Performance note: This is a terminal operation that must iterate through the entire enumeration to sum all values. For large enumerations, this may be expensive.<br/>‚ö†Ô∏è Overflow warning: Integer overflow may occur with very large sums. Consider using SumInt64 for larger ranges. |
| [ToBatch](./to_batch.go) | Groups elements from an enumeration into batches of specified size and returns them as a slice of slices. This operation is useful for processing large sequences in chunks, implementing pagination, or optimizing batch operations..<br/><br/>‚ö†Ô∏è Performance note: This is a terminal operation that must iterate through the entire enumeration to create all batches.<br/>‚ö†Ô∏è Memory note: This operation buffers all elements in memory during processing. |
| [ToChannel](./to_channel.go) | Converts an enumeration to a channel that yields all elements. This operation is useful for converting lazy enumerations into channel-based processing pipelines or for interoperability with goroutines.<br/><br/>‚ö†Ô∏è Resource management: This operation starts a goroutine that runs until the enumeration is complete. Always consume all elements or the goroutine may block indefinitely.<br/>‚ö†Ô∏è Blocking behavior: The goroutine will block when trying to send to a full channel if there's no reader. Use appropriate buffer size.<br/>‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: If the returned channel is not fully consumed, the goroutine may leak. Always range over the entire channel or ensure proper cleanup. |
| [ToMap](./to_map.go) | Converts an enumeration to a map[T]struct{} for efficient set-like operations. This operation is useful for creating memory-efficient lookup collections or for removing duplicates while materializing an enumeration.<br/><br/>‚ö†Ô∏è Performance note: This is a terminal operation that must iterate through the entire enumeration. For large enumerations, this may be expensive.<br/>‚ö†Ô∏è Memory note: This operation buffers all unique elements in memory. The memory usage depends on the number of unique elements.<br/>‚ÑπÔ∏è Available only for comparable types. |
| [ToSlice](./to_slice.go) | Converts an enumeration to a slice containing all elements. This operation is useful for materializing lazy enumerations into concrete collections.<br/><br/>‚ö†Ô∏è Performance note: This is a terminal operation that must iterate through the entire enumeration to collect all elements. For large enumerations, this may be expensive in both time and memory.<br/>‚ö†Ô∏è Memory note: This operation buffers all elements in memory. |
